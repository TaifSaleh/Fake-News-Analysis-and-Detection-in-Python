# Fake-News-Analysis-and-Detection-in-Python
“Fake News Net” A Comprehensive Framework for Fake News Analysis and Detection in Python Langague 

In this project I used TfidfVectorizer which is a tool used in Python to help in analyzing and detecting fake news. 
It converts text data into numerical features based on the TF-IDF values of words. 
Using this tool help in preprocess text, extract important features, train a model on labeled data, and then use LogisticRegression to classify new articles as fake or real.

In this project I used Logistic Regression algorithm, it is a machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary classification tasks, such as fake news detection. 
It works by learning the relationship between input features like TF-IDF values of words in news articles and the binary target variable (fake or real).
